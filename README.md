# Hello, World! 👋

I'm a student at the **University of Alberta** 🎓, currently diving deep into the world of computer science and loving every minute of it!

## What I'm Working On 💻

- **CS50x Final Project**: I am working on my final project for CS50x, harvards free introductory to computer science course where I'm developing a file encryption tool using C. It will incorporate some of the best encyption methods such as AES, RSA and ECC.

- **CS50P Coursework**: I'm actively working through CS50P, harvards free introductory to python course.

## Future Plans 🚀

I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn. I plan on working through the free CS50AI offered by Harvard once I am done with CS50X.

I also plan on pursuing a bachelors degree with a double major in computer science and statistics at the University of Alberta!
